## Key Decisions
- Each AI:
- Doesn't know what the others did
- Doesn't remember its own previous decisions
- Makes assumptions about current state
- Confidently overwrites prior work

**Current "Solution":** You become the human memory bank, copying context between conversations, trying to remember what was decided when
- **Traction:** 
- Clear problem/solution fit validated with pilot users
- Technical architecture proven (event-sourced, MCP-integrated)
- 21-day path to MVP mapped
- Multiple potential customer segments identified

**Looking For:**
- Full-stack engineer who's felt this exact pain
- Experience with: Swift/SwiftUI (Mac-first), Git internals, event sourcing
- Bonus: MCP (Model Context Protocol) exposu
- If the phrase "context fragmentation across tools" resonates, we should talk

## Errors & Gotchas
- From your genesis document, I can see you were dealing with line 462 runtime errors and connection issues between popup.js and content scripts
- **Task States** (not just done/not done):
   - ‚úÖ Complete
   - üîÑ Complete with iterations (show count)
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked (show blocker)
   - üöß Partial (show % or substeps)
   - ‚ùå Failed (show why)
   - ‚¨ú Not started

## Code Changes
- File: chat_reframe2.md
- Code implementation
- File: auth.js

## Next Steps
- **For Each Tool, Assess:**
- Native vs Electron vs Web
- Design quality (screenshot if possible)
- How they handle persistent state
- Workflow building approach
- Target user (dev vs ops vs business)
- What they'd need to add to match duoecho studio
- What duoecho studio could learn from them

**Also Research:**
- Figma/Sketch plugins for AI workflow design
- Apple Shortcuts with AI actions
- Micr
- What would be the first step to implement
- ## The Insight: Task Decomposition with Reality

Most tools show either:
- **Simple checkboxes** ‚úÖ (too basic, hides complexity)
- **Full Gantt charts** (too overwhelming)

You need what PMs actually track:
- Step 1 ‚úÖ (but took 20 debug sessions - flag for retrospective)
- Step 2 ‚è∏Ô∏è (blocked on Step 3a)
- Step 3 ‚úÖ (main done)
  - Step 3a ‚ùå (substep not done - blocking Step 2)
- Step 4-6 ‚úÖ (complet
