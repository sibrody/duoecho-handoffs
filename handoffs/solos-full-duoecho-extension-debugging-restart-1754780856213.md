### **Human** (6:24:03 PM)

1. Fetch and read, GitHub: sibrody/**duoecho-handoffs/**handoffs/solos-full-duoecho-extension-debugging-restart-1754778059096.md
2. Understand the context of existing activities by reading the "Full handoff" and paying particular focus to the last 20% of the conversation. Confirm you have read the full handoff COMPLETELY and readback current state.
3. You were in the middle of implementing the surgical fixes at the end: "Yesss—nice win. Let’s make the HUD always visible and let you choose the corner. Minimal, surgical, 3 tiny patches."
4. Active codebase is: ~/Dev/duoecho/extension
5. Confirm your understand of where we are and why.
6. Identify succinctly  and crisply your plan of action. No coding.

 I'll help you get back up to speed. Let me start by fetching and reading the GitHub handoff document to understand the full context.

### **Human** (6:24:36 PM)

Yes

### **Assistant** (6:25:48 PM)

 Perfect! Let me implement the 3 surgical patches to make the HUD always visible with corner positioning.

## **Patch 1: Options UI - Add HUD controls**

### **Human** (6:36:50 PM)

It appears to work but the Tokens Left shows the full 1200. I am testing to see if it requires me to submit a text to generate the actual count. Indicate Yes or No.

### **Assistant** (6:36:55 PM)

 **No.**

The HUD should update immediately when you click "Capture" in the popup, even without submitting new text. The token count represents tokens used in the **signal generation process** (converting the existing conversation to a compressed format), not tokens from submitting new messages.

When you click Capture, it should show:
- 0% → "TOKENS LEFT: 1200" 
- 50% → "TOKENS LEFT: 600" (after writing full handoff)
- 100% → "TOKENS LEFT: ~100" (after signal generation, depending on conversation size)

If it's stuck at 1200, the progress messages from the background script aren't reaching the HUD properly, or the capture process isn't running as expected.
