# SolOS - Debug Signal

## Key Decisions
- Let me think through the design options:

## **Current Issue:**
- Colored background makes text hard to read
- Progress bar isn't clearly showing "how full" we are (it's showing tokens consumed, not a clear 0-100% progress)

## **Two Design Approaches:**

### **Option A: Keep Progress Bar, Fix Colors**
- **Background**: Always black/dark (readable text)
- **Progress Bar**: Changes color based on %
- **Excellent refinement!** You're absolutely right - if we're going for **no progress bar** and **maximum legibility**, we should eliminate the bar element entirely and focus on the clean approach

## Errors & Gotchas
- If you donâ€™t have safeTabSendMessage, add the harmless wrapper you had:

```
function safeTabSendMessage(tabId, msg) {
  try {
    if (!tabId) { console.debug('[SW] no lastActiveTabId, skipping HUD send'); return; }
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, msg, () => {
      const e = chrome.runtime.lastError;
      if (e) console.debug('[SW] tabs.sendMessage (harmless):', e.message);
    });
  } catch 
- Broken Badge Updates**
**What happened**: In the final fix, I replaced all `emitProgress()` calls with direct `safeTabSendMessage()` calls

## Code Changes
- Function: updateHudDisplay
- Function: hudColorTheme
- Function: hexToRgba

## Next Steps
- You were in the middle of implementing the surgical fixes at the end: "Yesssâ€”nice win
- Let me implement the 3 surgical patches to make the HUD always visible with corner positioning
- Let me implement the 3 tiny patches to make the HUD persist properly:

## **Patch 1: Persist last progress across reloads**
